- What is Git and Github?

> Git
 
- Git is a version control system.
- It tracks changes in your code or files.
- You can go back to previous versions, see history, or work with others safely.
- Works locally on your computer.
- Example: You write a program, then change it. Git lets you save each version so you can return if needed.

> GitHub

- GitHub is an online platform (website) for Git.
- It stores your Git projects in the cloud.
- Lets you share code with others, collaborate, and see projects from other people.
- Think of GitHub as Google Drive for Git projects.

		Git = tool to track code
