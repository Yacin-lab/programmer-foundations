### What is Binary?
Computers understand only two values: `0` and `1`
Memory stores data in binary, Like (numbers, letters, programs, images ...)

### Memory
A running program uses `RAM` memory.
It's divided into two important parts: `Stack` and `Heap`

- What is Stack?
  * Automatic memory
  * Very fast
  * Used for local variables and function calls

Characteristics
  * Memory is created automatically
  * Memory is freed automatically
  * Limited size
  * Follows Last In, First Out

- What is Heap?
  * Dynamic memory
  * Used for manual memory reservation
    
  ⚠️​ Memory must be freed manually

Characteristics
  * Slower than stack
  * Much larger than stack

> [!NOTE]
> Stack errors → stack overflow
> Heap errors → memory leaks
